# Business Recommendations – Olist E-Commerce Analysis

## Executive Summary 

We analyzed customer buying behavior on the Olist marketplace to understand **why customers do not return after their first purchase**.

**Bottom line:**
Customers are **not leaving because they buy less or spend less**.  
They leave because **nothing brings them back after their first order**.

Customers behave normally until they suddenly stop buying.  
This means churn **cannot be predicted early**, but it **can be prevented with the right actions**.

## What We Learned (Key Insights)

### 1. Revenue Depends Mostly on New Customers
- Only about **3 out of every 100 customers** make a second purchase
- Most customers place **one order and never return**
- Revenue growth currently comes from **new customer acquisition**, not loyalty

**What this means:**  
The business is spending money to acquire customers but **not maximizing their lifetime value**.

---

### 2. Customers Do NOT Show Warning Signs Before Leaving
We checked whether customers who churn:
- buy fewer items
- spend less money
- have lower average order value

**Result:**  
There is **no meaningful difference** between customers who return and those who don’t — until they stop buying entirely.

**What this means:**  
There are **no early warning signals** that tell us a customer is about to leave.

### 3. Churn Happens Suddenly
Customers do not slowly reduce their spending.
Instead:
- they make a purchase
- receive the order
- disappear

**What this means:**  
Waiting for “churn signals” is too late.  
Action must happen **immediately after the first purchase**.

---

## What the Business Should Do (Recommended Actions)

### 1. Focus on the First Purchase Experience
The first order is the **most important moment**.

Recommended actions:
- Send a follow-up message after delivery (email / WhatsApp / SMS)
- Offer a **small discount** on the second order
- Show personalized product recommendations within **7–14 days**

Goal:  
Turn a first-time buyer into a repeat customer **as quickly as possible**.

---

### 2. Use Time-Based Triggers Instead of Behavior
Instead of analyzing spending patterns, track **time since last purchase**.

Example retention strategy:
- No second order within **30 days** → reminder or offer
- No second order within **60 days** → stronger incentive
- No second order within **90 days** → final re-engagement attempt

This approach is simple, reliable, and actionable.

---

### 3. Measure the Right Success Metrics
Move beyond only tracking revenue.

Key metrics to track:
- Second-purchase conversion rate
- Time taken to place a second order
- Retention lift from campaigns

These metrics directly show whether retention efforts are working.

## Strategic Conclusion (For Decision Makers)

For the Olist marketplace:

- Customer churn **cannot be accurately predicted early**
- Machine learning is **not the solution** to this problem
- Retention must be **designed through customer experience**
- The biggest opportunity lies **after the first purchase**

The core business question is not:

> “Who is going to churn?”

It is:

> **“How quickly can we bring customers back for a second purchase?”**
