# Business Questions

## Business Context
This project simulates an e-commerce marketplace facing slowing revenue growth and increasing customer churn.
Leadership wants to make data-driven decisions around pricing, customer retention, and segmentation.

The goal of this analysis is to support **decision-making**, not just generate metrics.

## Key Business Decisions

### 1. Pricing & Discounts
- Do discounts actually increase repeat purchases?
- Are discounts improving revenue or hurting long-term customer value?
- Which customer segments are most discount-sensitive?

### 2. Customer Retention
- Which customers are at the highest risk of churn?
- Can we identify early warning signals of churn using historical behavior?
- Which customers should be prioritized for retention efforts?

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- Are all customers equally valuable to the business?
- Can customers be grouped into meaningful segments based on behavior?
- How should business strategy differ across customer segments?

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if it:
- Produces clear, interpretable insights tied to business decisions
- Quantifies trade-offs (e.g., revenue vs retention)
- Avoids over-complex modeling in favor of explainable analytics
