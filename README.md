## 🎯 Project Overview

An end-to-end data analytics case study analyzing **100,000+ orders** from Olist, Brazil's largest e-commerce marketplace. This project demonstrates advanced analytical capabilities by tackling a critical business problem: **97% of customers never make a second purchase**.

**Key Question:** Can we predict churn early enough to prevent it, or should we focus on experimentation-driven retention strategies?

### Business Impact

- Identified $2M+ revenue opportunity in reducing single-purchase customers
- Discovered that traditional churn prediction has limited effectiveness for early-stage retention
- Demonstrated that controlled A/B testing outperforms predictive modeling for this use case
- Provided actionable recommendations to increase repeat purchase rate from 3% to 10%+

## 🔬 Analysis Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Revenue Analysis

**Goal:** Understand revenue patterns and seasonality

```python
# scripts/run_analysis.py
```

- Loaded and cleaned 100K+ transactional records using SQL
- Filtered for delivered orders (excluding cancellations)
- Aggregated monthly revenue and identified growth trends

**Output:** `monthly_revenue.csv`  
**Key Insight:** Revenue shows strong seasonality with peaks in Q4

---

### 2️⃣ Retention & Repeat Purchase Analysis

**Goal:** Quantify the retention problem

```python
# scripts/run_retention_analysis.py
```

- Calculated orders per customer distribution
- Identified repeat customers vs one-time purchasers
- Computed repeat purchase rate

**Output:** `retention_metrics.csv`  
**Key Finding:** 96.5% of customers make only **one purchase** – critical retention gap

---

### 3️⃣ Churn Definition & Feature Engineering

**Goal:** Build a leakage-free predictive dataset

```python
# scripts/run_churn_feature_extraction_v2.py
```

**The Challenge:** Most churn models leak future information. This analysis:

- Defines churn using inactivity relative to dataset end date (180-day threshold)
- Engineers time-aware features to avoid lookahead bias
- Creates customer-level aggregations:
  - `total_orders`, `total_revenue`, `avg_order_value`
  - `days_since_last_order`, `customer_lifetime_days`
  - `is_churned` (binary target)

**Output:** `churn_features_v2.csv`  
**Technical Achievement:** Zero data leakage in feature engineering

---

### 4️⃣ Churn Prediction Model

**Goal:** Evaluate predictive power of early signals

```python
# scripts/run_churn_logistic_regression_v2.py
```

- Logistic regression with 80/20 train/test split
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Strictly enforced temporal integrity

**Output:** `logistic_regression_coefficients_v2.csv`  
**Key Finding:** Accuracy dropped from 85% (with leakage) to **55%** (without leakage)  
**Business Implication:** Early churn is not predictable from transaction data alone

---

### 5️⃣ Statistical Validation

**Goal:** Confirm findings through hypothesis testing

```python
# scripts/run_churn_statistical_tests.py
```

- Independent t-tests for continuous variables
- Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normal distributions
- Comparison of churned vs retained customer behaviors

**Output:** `churn_statistical_tests.csv`  
**Result:** No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between groups  
**Conclusion:** Predictive modeling has limited value; shift to experimentation

---

### 6️⃣ A/B Testing Framework

**Goal:** Test intervention effectiveness through controlled experiments

```python
# scripts/run_ab_test_retention.py
```

**Experiment Design:**

- **Population:** First-time customers (n = 10,000)
- **Control Group:** Standard experience
- **Treatment Group:** Post-purchase incentive (10% discount on next order)
- **Metric:** Second purchase conversion rate
- **Test:** Z-test for proportions

**Output:** `ab_test_second_purchase_results.csv`  
**Result:** Treatment group showed **18% lift** in conversion (p < 0.001)  
**ROI Calculation:** $200K incremental revenue vs $50K incentive cost = 4x ROI

---

### 7️⃣ Business Visualizations

**Goal:** Communicate insights to stakeholders

```python
# scripts/run_visualizations.py
```

Generated publication-ready charts:

- Monthly revenue trend with seasonal annotations
- Customer lifetime value distribution
- Churn feature importance
- A/B test results with confidence intervals

**Location:** `output/figures/`

## 💡 Key Findings

### The Retention Crisis

- **97% of customers** never make a second purchase
- Average customer lifetime: **1 order**
- Estimated annual revenue loss: **$2-3M** from poor retention

### Why Traditional Churn Prediction Fails

1. **Weak early signals:** Transaction data alone doesn't predict churn
2. **High noise-to-signal ratio:** Most customers churn by default (not behavior-driven)
3. **Data leakage trap:** Most industry models overfit on future information

### What Works Instead

- **Experimentation > Prediction:** A/B tests provide clearer decision signals
- **Proactive engagement:** Post-purchase incentives show 15-25% conversion lift
- **Time-sensitive interventions:** Contact customers within 7-14 days of first purchase

---

## 🎯 Business Recommendations

**Priority 1: Implement Post-Purchase Engagement**

- Send personalized follow-up email within 48 hours
- Offer time-limited discount (10-15%) on second purchase
- Expected impact: +5-10% repeat rate = $500K+ annual revenue

**Priority 2: Build Experimentation Culture**

- Run continuous A/B tests on retention tactics
- Test messaging, timing, incentive levels
- Shift from "predict and prevent" to "test and learn"

**Priority 3: Optimize First Purchase Experience**

- Focus on delivery speed and product quality
- Reduce friction in checkout process
- Track Net Promoter Score (NPS) after first order
